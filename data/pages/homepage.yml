      Spring Run is a place to enjoy a happy life and to play. There will be two
      large grassed parks for the entire community. The first park will be ready
      for family fun in the fall of 2017. The combined parks will have
      playground equipment with swings, slides, climbing, a pavilion & tables
      for playing and dreaming.


      The parks will be connected to the community by over 5 miles of trails for
      walking, jogging and biking. Trails will lead to a hill-top park with
      commanding views of the Wasatch mountains and Utah Lake.


      The townhomes will also have their own private places to play. It will
      have its own childrenâ€™s park, a clubhouse, a swimming pool and meandering
      trails through the village. Come have fun with us!
