      Spring Run is a place to play and enjoy a happy life. There will be two
      large grassed parks for the

      entire community. The first park is ready for family fun. The two parks
      will have playground

      equipment with slides, climbing, strength & skill features. They will
      include pickle ball courts, basket

      ball and a pavilion with tables. The parks are are designed for playing
      and dreaming.

      The parks will be connected to the community by over 5 miles of trails for
      walking, jogging and

      biking. Trails will lead to a hill-top park with commanding views of the
      Wasatch mountains and Utah

      Lake.

      The townhomes will also have their own private places to play. They will
      have a clubhouse, a

      swimming pool and meandering trails through the village.
