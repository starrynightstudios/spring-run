  Spring Run is a place to enjoy a happy life and to play. There will be two
  large grassed parks for the entire community. The first park will be ready for
  family fun in the fall of 2017. The combined parks will have playground
  equipment with swings, slides, climbing, a pavilion & tables for playing and
  dreaming.


  The parks will be connected to the community by over \_\_\_\_ miles of trails
  for walking, jogging and biking. Trails will lead to a hill-top park with
  commanding views of the Wasatch mountains and Utah Lake.


  The townhomes will also have their own private places to play. It will have
  its own childrenâ€™s park, a clubhouse, a swimming pool and meandering trails
  through the village. Come have fun with us!
